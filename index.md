## who's indra?

Oh, just your average lab gremlin trying to quantum-chemistry his way through an Integrated PhD at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I'm currently marinating in caffeine and confusion at the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit (SSCU). 

Graduated in Chemistry from Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission Residential College — yes, the one with monks. Now I hang out in Dr. Vivek Tiwari's Multidimensional Spectroscopy and Imaging Group (joined May 2023), pretending to understand lasers, light-matter coupling, and why my code won't compile.

Still reading? Wow. You can reach me at [indranilroy@iisc.ac.in](mailto:indranilroy@iisc.ac.in), if you're into that sort of thing.

## indra's webpage: what is its purpose?

A shrine to half-baked scripts, command-line wizardry, and other scientific computing oddities that I swear worked *on my machine*. If you're looking for polished software, try NASA. If you're looking for quick fixes and chaos — welcome.
